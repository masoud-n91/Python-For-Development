# Rememberall 

You don't want to become like Neville Longbottom, USE this API.

## root
You can get the main idea here

## get("/todo")
If you want to know what to do, send this get request to the API

## post("/todo")
Wanna add something? this endpoint is created for you. Don't forget to send the form with your request!!

## delete("/todo/{ID}")
Wanna move on? Delete what you don't need. Give the ID of your task in the end of the endpoint.

## put("/todo/{ID}")
I knew it!! Your even enter what you want to do correctly. No problem. Edit your task here. Give the ID after the endpoint and then send the form with it.

## NOTE
If a form is needed and you forget to send it with your request (which I know you will), you'll see an error. Try harder next time :)
